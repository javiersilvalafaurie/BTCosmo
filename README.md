# COVARIANCE_jacknifes_vs_mocksLC
In this work we explore the differences between using covariance matrix from 1) jacknifes data and 2) mocks on light-cones in the work >><<

The codes are in jupyter notebooks and python files. To run them we recommend Anaconda, which includes all the libraries. Nevertheless you also need to install CLASS library (https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public).

In xi_0_2_power_spectrum_creator.ipynb we created the power spectrums with and without wiggles using a fiducial cosmology (Planck 2015)

In xi_0_2_MCMC.ipynb we run a MCMC algorithm to constrain cosmological information from BOSS CMASS
